# Bike_Rider_tableau_dashboard
Developed a dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze bike ridership patterns during specific holidays. The dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize operations during peak holiday periods.

#### Key Features:
Interactive Calendar View: Implemented a calendar view highlighting holidays, allowing users to explore ridership trends on specific days.
Ridership Metrics: Displayed key metrics such as total rides, average ride duration, and peak hours during holidays, enabling quick assessments of rider demand.
Comparison with Regular Days: Included a comparative analysis with non-holiday periods to identify the impact of holidays on bike ridership, helping in resource allocation and staffing decisions.
User Segmentation: Implemented filters to segment riders based on user types (casual, registered) and visualize how each group contributes to overall ridership during holidays.

#### Actionable Insights:
Optimal Staffing: Identified peak hours during holidays using heatmap to optimize staffing levels, ensuring an adequate supply of bikes and providing better service to riders.
Marketing Opportunities: Discovered specific holidays with lower ridership, presenting opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns to incentivize bike usage during those periods.
Technologies Used: Tableau, Data Integration, Bike-sharing Platform Data.

### Outcome: The Tableau dashboard facilitated data-driven decision-making, resulting in an increase in operational efficiency during holidays and an improvement in overall user satisfaction.
